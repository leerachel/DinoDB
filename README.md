Learnt Web-Scraping in Python online, took a while to learn the excel library function -> Combining Pandas and OpenPyXL
Main steps of Web-Scraping:
- Finding out the HTML tags and ids, to grab the information you need
- Learning to sift through information, extracting the ones you need
- Organising and writing them into Excel

Most challenging part:
- Adapting to irregular formats (e.g. pictures in between paragraphs / extra unrelated paragraphs)
- Solution: Find out the specific ids of these cases and writing a function to skip processing them

Thinking of adding pictures to the dinos, and maybe their diet and characteristics (height and weight) 
But first, I need to set up a database to hold my dinos, and then proceed to launch them online and see how it goes.
